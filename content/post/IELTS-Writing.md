Given are two pie charts depicting the statistics of various energy resources used in electricity production in 1970 and 1980.

In 1970, coal was the most significant composition of electricity production, with the percentage of 47%. By contrast, the proportion of natural gas was just 24%, which occupied nearly half of the figure for coal. Following this, hydro and oil took up a close share, standing at 16% and 12% respectively. To the last point, there was merely 1% of American electricity generated by nuclear, reported to be the least widely applied energy resource.

A decade later, there was a marginal climb in the data of coal from 47% to 51%, possessing still the first place. Likewise, another increase can be witnessed in the percentage of nuclear from 1% to 11% in 1980. On the contrary, all the other energy production experienced a decline. Natural gas displayed the most dramatically dropping trend from 24% to 15%. Simultaneously, the composition of hydro and oil both reduced to 12% and 11% separately.

To summarise, coal was consistently the most essential resource for American energy supply.

In 1981, teachers’ salaries were the largest spending of this school, accounting for 40%. In contrast, other workers’ salaries covered merely 28%, which was much less than the former. Following this, the figure for resource and equipment shared exactly identical proportion, both at 15%. Lastly, there was only 2% of the school expense spent on insurance, with the percentage of only 2%.

During the follow two decades, there was at first a slight growth in the proportion of teachers’ salaries from 40% to 50%, after which was a decline to 45% in 2001. Similarly, the figure for books and resource displayed the same trend, rising from 15% to 20% and then back to 9%. Contrarily, the composition of equipment spending experienced initially a modest drop from 15% to 5% before bouncing back/recovering to 23%. Simultaneously,  …

Overall, payment/wage for the teachers was constantly/consistently the most essential expenditure of the school.

The pie charts show how water is taken and emptied by human body, measured in the unit of c.c. and depicted in two separate charts.

First of all, regarding to the water intake of human body, 1500c.c. of the water is absorbed via fluids, which is the larger composition of water intake. The rest is through solid food, with the amount of 1000c.c.

When it comes to the water output, the most significant approach is liquid water kidneys, standing at 1500c.c. This is followed by sweat, which occupies 500c.c. Sharing a close composition, the corresponding data of water output through lungs is 400c.c. To the last point, solid wastes, as the least crucial part, reports the data of merely 100c.c.

To summarise, despite that there are more diverse methods of water output of human body, the main way of water intake and output both relies on water in liquid form.

The bar chart given demonstrates the variations in the proportion of employees with different education backgrounds in a company (1991-2002).

Primarily, the number of employees with a secondary education background experienced a considerable decline from 60, which was once the most significant composition of the company in 1991, to 19 in 2000.

Contrary to that, there was at first a sharp growth in the number of bachelors employed from 20 to 43 in 1996, superseding the secondary educated staff and taking up the largest proportion. It was followed then by a slight drop to 33 in 2000, reported still to rank at/possess the first position.

In addition, the quantity of postgraduates in the enterprise indicated an evidently growing trend. The most dramatic climb can be observed in the number of masters from 2 to 25, which outnumbered the figure for secondary in 2000. Meanwhile, the data of Ph.Ds. increased slightly from none to 5 in the end, remaining consistently as the fewest in number.

To summarise/in general, the proportion of co-workers/ colleagues who received higher education displayed an upward trend.

The table lists the detailed statistics of six underground systems in the major cities in the world.



To start with, built in 1863, London tube is 394km long, which is the oldest and longest of all the underground systems listed. Likewise, with the length of 199km, Paris metro, as the underground transport with the second longest length and history, was constructed in 1900. In stark contrast, however, Kyoto underground, covering merely 11km, is the shortest among the six cities, which was accomplished in 1981. Simultaneously, subway in LA was completed in 2001, reported to be the most recently built, and the length of it is just 28km.

Unexpectedly, the largest number of passengers cannot be found in London, but in Tokyo, transporting 1927 million travellers per year. This is followed by the corresponding data of Paris, with the figure of 1191 million. In contrast, there are only 144 million citizens in Washington DC commuting with underground annually, which is overwhelmingly fewer than the formers. To the last point, the carrying capacity of Kyoto underground ranks the last, standing at 45 million.

Overall, the underground railway with an earlier opening data tends to cover a longer length. The yearly passengers, however, do not follow the same pattern.

.. cannot be concluded in this pattern/marking.

The map provided demonstrates the alterations that take place before and after the tourist development on an island.

Before the construction, the given place is an isolated island located at the middle of the sea. For the size of the island, it is measured horizontally longer than vertically on map, with the estimated length of over 200m. To be more specific, there are no artificial buildings that can be seen on the island, but covered by several trees. Lastly, a natural beach can also be located to the left shore of the island.

After the rearrangement, the evident change is the newly built pier, which is connected to the reception at the centre of the island trough vehicle track. Behind the reception, there is a recently constructed restaurant, offering catering services for the tourists. What should also be noticed is the accommodations planed for the travellers to both sides of the reception, linked with each other via footpaths. To the last point, a swimming area is also developed surrounding the beach.

To summarise, the originally undeveloped/ unexploited/ virgin island is converted into a suitable travelling destination.

T-junction/joint

C13T1
Given are two maps illustrating the alterations in the road connection to City Hospital in two given years (2007 and 2010).

In 2007, starting from the south, the City Road in east-west direction intersected with the Hospital Road. Along the Hospital Road to the north, six bus stops can be seen at both sides of the road, with a car park planned for both staff and the public to the further eastern area of the bus stops. At the northern end of Hospital Road, a T-joint can be discovered, linked to the Ring Road. Lastly, surrounded by the Ring Road was the City Hospital.

3 years later, the T-junction and the crossroad of City Road and Hospital Road were both converted into roundabouts. The bus stops at the western side of the road were enlarged into a bus station connected to both roundabouts, while the bus stops on the opposite side were removed. The car park, simultaneously, was rearranged solely for staff in 2010. Furthermore, another car park east to the Ring Road was newly constructed for the public and City Hospital kept mainly unchanged.

Overall, a more complex road access to the City Hospital was established after the three years duration.

The diagram given depicts the entire procedure of how to make bread. Generally speaking, it is a relatively interesting/complex/simple process including 6 stages.

At the very beginning, warm water and sugar should be mixed with yeast in order to activate it. Afterwards, first mixture needs to be added with more water, flour and salt to form the dough. The following step is to knead the dough for 10 minutes so that it becomes smooth and shiny. Having done this, the dough will be left in a warm place to rise. 1-3 hours later, a few minutes of kneading and punching are required to release the air inside. To finish the process of bread making, what should be done at last is to shape loaves. After another hour of rising, the unfinished toast should be eventually placed into the oven of 200˚C for 10 to 15 minutes.

To summarise, all these instructions/description/steps above conclude the whole progress of how bread is made.

Excavation

The dough is kneaded for 10 minutes.
10 minutes of kneading is needed.
The next step is to knead the dough.

Afterwards, first mixture needs to be added with more water, flour and salt to form the dough, which is about to be kneaded for 10 minutes to make it smooth and shiny.

Warm water and sugar should be added into the yeast.

The first step of brick manufacture is to dig the clay using a digger.
What should be done next is called pasteurization, which is to warm the milk to 63˚C for 30 minutes to kill bacteria.

After being pumped and cooled to 30˚C, starter is needed to ripen milk.

30 to 60 minutes later, coagulant, for instance rennet, should be stirred into the milk to obtain/get whey and curds.

Eggs are produced by the moth, which will grow into silkworm larva feeding on mulberry leaves in 10 days. 

silk threads are produced by the larva.

When it comes to the production of silk cloth, cocoons that fit certain criteria should be selected as the raw material of cloth production. Following this, the selected cocoons need to be boiled in water before the next stage of unwinding, which restores the cocoon back to silk threads that range from 300 -900m. Having done this, before the last step of dyeing, there are two options available. One is to solely twist the threads, while the other requires another procedure of weaving between the steps of twisting and dyeing.

Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, pictures, music or film) in whichever way they wish. There should be no government restrictions on what they do.
To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion? 

Artists	better creation/ better works
Government	save resources/ administrative costs/ open-minded
Citizens/public/audiences    better appreciation/ higher cultural level

The behaviors of the artists are considered increasingly absurd/ ridiculous/ unacceptable/ across the bottom line of morality. However, from my point of view, this cannot be taken as an excuse to limit the freedom of artists.

First and foremost, freedom plays the most essential role in promoting art creation. Freedom of artists can stimulate more inspirations and space for them, which enables them to express their inner thoughts/emotions without any obstacles. As a result, there will be more abundant artistic themes as well as forms emerging, contributing to more unique art works. Their authors, consequently, would enjoy/receive more prevalence and fortune. Apparently, without freedom, none of those remarkable masterpieces would be possible.

Apart from this, freedom also provides the government with numerous conveniences in daily administration. By abolishing those unnecessary government regulations in art industry, a considerable number of administrative costs can be reduced, effectively saving limited/ finite budgets for the government. The saved amount can be accordingly invested in other crucial social sectors such as funding art education or more art galleries, which establishes an open-minded yet responsible image for the authorities and wins public support.

Last but not least, a liberal social environment lays the solid foundation for cultural prosperity. More frequent communication would take place, which facilitates the interaction and fusion among various arts. The innovation in art industry resulting from cultural exchange gives rise to a profusion of new art genres and offers more possibilities to the audiences for art appreciation. Evidently, it is freedom of the artists that enriches the leisure time entertainment and local cultural diversity.

By way of conclusion, after analyzing all sorts of benefits/advantages/merits of freedom in art creation, I strongly support the idea that the freedom of artists should be protected/guaranteed/ensured under any circumstances.

Imbalanced sex ratio in university is recognized as a severe problem in high education. However, equal admission from both genders cannot be regarded as a proper solution to this issue.

The phenomenon of irrational consumption can be frequently observed in modern society. As far as I am concerned, this is mainly caused by the influence of advertising.

Some people believe that visitors to other countries should follow local customs and behavior. Others disagree and think that the host country should welcome cultural differences.
Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. 
	Pros	Cons

	Respect / avoid conflicts/ safety	
Welcome cultural differences	Comfortable/ tourism/ economy	
	Cultural diversity -	
Frequent cultural conflicts caused by global tourism have exerted a profound negative impact on the relationship between tourists and local residents. As far as I am concerned, to solve this problem, efforts from both sides are of great necessity.

On one hand, following local customs and behavior is an extremely advisable suggestion to the visitors. PRIMARILY, a more abundant travelling experience can be achieved by trying to learn local cultural traditions. Through participating in more native cultural events, the travellers can acquire/procure an in-depth understanding of local lifestyle and society, contributing to the accumulations of knowledge about different areas/regions of the world. Evidently, not following local customs would only lead to a meaningless journey. SECONDARILY, it is also an appropriate approach to show respect to local culture. Abiding by local rules can efficiently reduce the risk of offending those uncertain cultural taboos in local society, which consequently avoids those unnecessary conflicts between both sides. This not only establishes a harmonious atmosphere in global tourism, but also ensures the safety of the tourists.

On the other hand, host country should also accept diverse cultural elements from different backgrounds. The first reason supporting my argument is that by showing an open image to the outside world, more tourists would be attracted to visit this particular country. With the growth in the number of visits, there will be increasing demand for consumption and services, which gives rise to larger scale of production and more relevant job positions. The local tourism and economy can be eventually boosted to a large extent. Another factor is that local cultural diversity can also be enriched when embracing exotic culture. The communication between travellers and local populace is conducive to the fusion and exchange among various cultures, so that more copious lifestyles would arise. The local citizens can therefore enjoy more possibilities for leisure time entertainment.

In conclusion, after investigating in the two given views, it is apparent that there are no contradictions de facto between the visitors and local inhabitants. A possible solution de jure to this issue is to encourage/ advocate for more mutual understanding and tolerance from each other.

In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies.
Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this. 
Do the advantages of doing so out weigh its disadvantages?
Is it a positive or negative phenomenon?

Pros and cons
Gap Year
+: enlarge social network/ practical working skill/ social experience (personal development)
   financial support for the family/ earn the tuition fee/ reduce the burden of parents
   broaden horizon/ explore personal interest/ self actualization/ satisfaction/ happiness

-: waste one year time/ later graduation/ age disadvantage
  abandon study/ forget the knowledge from secondary/ not suitable mental status for study/ self exile
  waste money
  personal safety

The number of students who decide to spend one more year outside campus before entering university experiences a considerable growth recently. From my perspective, the choice of gap year has more merits than disadvantages.

反例：
First of all, the most evident demerit of gap year is that it wastes one year precious time for the teenagers. The later admission caused by gap year would consequently lead to later graduation, which brings about the age disadvantage to the graduates. There will be numerous negative impacts on the start of their career path, considering the HR’ preference of younger employees/interviewees. This would eventually give rise to severe problems in the career development of the students.

让步：
Of course, admittedly, gap year is not a 100%/absolutely perfect choice for each student who decides to do so. For instance, the possible later graduation might be a concern for the graduates, especially for their parents, which would probably set up potential obstacles/ barriers when starting their career. However, this drawback can be effectively overcome by the experience gained during gap year. 


To be more specific, gap year contributes to a more satisfied personal development for the youngsters. ….

It is generally acknowledged that families are not as close as they used to be.
Give possible reasons and recommendations.

Reason: 1. Life pressure               2. Technology distraction
Solution: 1. Balance family and career   2. Limit the use of electronic device

Indifferent family relationship can be easily observed in nowadays society. To my knowledge, life pressure and technology distraction are the two main causes leading to this phenomenon. 

To be more specific, the first reason for unconcerned family relationship is the intensive stress from survival/career. To adapt to the increasingly fierce competition in career field, the employees have no choice but to devote more personal time and energy to working, which leads to endless overtime working or business trips. The time that could have been spent with family is therefore occupied, hurting family relationship. Another significant factor is the interference from the advancement of modern technology. During family reunion, the family member, especially the younger generation, prefer to immerse themselves in the virtual world simulated by internet, ignoring the face to face communication with others. Obviously, the use of electronic devices such as smart phone or tablets exerts negative impacts on family relation.

The reasons for estranged family relationship, as discussed above, are fairly easy to be figured out. As for the solution to this issue, several suggestions are put forward/raised as follows. One of the most feasible approaches is to balance family and career development. To achieve that goal, more reasonable time management and higher working efficiency are of great necessity, so that meaningless overtime working can be avoided, contributing to more family time. Apart from that, the use of electronic gadgets should be strictly restricted during family time. Instead, more interactive and traditional family activities, e.g. playing Mahjong, family dinner or family trip, should be encouraged, which creates more common topics and memories with relatives. Consequently, a more intimate family relationship can be obtained.

By way of conclusion, the main reasons for distant family relationship are the career competition together with the negative influence from technology development. In order to resolve that, higher working efficiency and more traditional family events are required.

Time management  higher working efficiency  avoid unnecessary overtime working

Interactive   traditional family activities    relatives   more common topics and memories   communication  improved
